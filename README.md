# GoLmm
Game of Life in Gtkmm Cairomm 

It's just a self trainig example about use C++, gtkmm, cairomm, CMake and OpenCL in the close future. 
Putting all togheter to do a simple algorithm with a simple graphical animated output and, for me at least, a little psychedelic. 

It's also my second try to use activelly GitHub.
