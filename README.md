# GoLmm
Game of Life in Gtkmm Cairomm OpenCL

It's just a self trainig example about use C++, Gtkmm, Cairomm, OpenCL and CMake as build sysyem. 
Putting all togheter to do a simple algorithm with a simple graphical animated output and, for me at least, a little psychedelic. 

It's also my second try to use activelly GitHub.


OpenCL C++ support is a little mess at now, the opencl.hpp file should be in one of the the system include directories, but I had some trouble with CMake and OpenCL-CLHPP installations. For more info refer to https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-CLHPP.
